  <p>
    Since February of 2016, I am working as a Product Engineer for Pixida USA Inc. at BMW of North America.
    I’m mainly responsible for managing end to end Telematics projects for ConnectedDrive Services, including testing
    and validating IT deployments.
    These tasks have taught me a lot about how development teams work and how to build a professional relationship with
    these groups without compromising business requirements.
    In addition to my regular tasks, I was lately given the responsibility of Analyzing ConnectedDrive Data.
    In my previous job as a Consulting Engineer at SoftInWay Inc., I was responsible for supporting/leading partners and
    client’s projects. I learned and improved my technical knowledge about the turbomachinery industry, how to
    communicate and have a better relationship with clients.

    I believe my most valuable skill, above any engineering/technical expertise, is my empathy. The way I interact with
    people makes me a great team player and a good fit for most teams. I am also very passionate and challenged to do
    better every day.
    Working in a company where I can apply acquired knowledge and continuously keep learning and developing new skills
    has always been my greatest ambition. My enthusiasm and eagerness to work in the field will certainly make me an
    excellent member for your team.
